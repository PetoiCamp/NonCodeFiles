# NonCodeFiles

This folder contains 3D-printable parts for the Petoi robots. Some parts are not suitable for 3D printing due to their strength, elasticity, and internal support residues. If you need the complete model for simulation, please refer to the [ROS description files](https://github.com/PetoiCamp/ros_opencat/tree/ros1/petoi_ROS_model_docs)
