# Instruction
Bittle's neck is designed to detach when a head-on collision happens. It can prevent irreversible cracking in the structure. However, if you want the joint to be more robust in most cases, you can 3D print the following structures to fix the neck in place. 

1. NeckLockSmall takes a shorter time to print. It usually locks the neck and can still release the joint in a hard collision.

3. NeckLockLarge takes a longer time to print. It locks the whole neckpiece.

5. StrongLock is the latest solution to lock the neck using little materials.
